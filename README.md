## Project Overview

The Exquizite project is designed with end users in mind. We aim to create a seamless quiz creation and sharing experience that remains easy to use and adapt. The project is built using the following technologies and tools:

- Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: User interface library from Facebook.
- PostgreSQL: Open source relational database management system.
- Webpack: Module bundler.
